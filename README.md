# German Road Sign Classifier

## Overview

This project aims to classify German road signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) dataset, which contains over 50,000 images of 43 different classes of road signs. The classifier can be used for various applications in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).


## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:


git clone https://github.com/arvindselvamoorthy15/German-Road-Sign-Classifier.git
cd German-Road-Sign-Classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). You can download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the `data` directory.

# Download the dataset and extract it into the data directory
## Model Architecture

The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Finally, fully connected layers are added for classification.
