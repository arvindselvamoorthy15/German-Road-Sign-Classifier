# German Road Sign Classifier

## Overview

This project aims to classify German road signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) dataset, which contains over 50,000 images of 43 different classes of road signs. The classifier can be used for various applications in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
